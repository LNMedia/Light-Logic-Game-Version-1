# Light Logic Game (PHP)

This is an old browser-based PHP game project inspired by the classic "Lights Out" puzzle. The goal is to turn off all lights on the grid. Tapping a field toggles its state as well as the adjacent fields (top, bottom, left, right).

The project was never fully finished but went online on August 20th, 2024. It is no longer maintained and may not work in modern environments without adjustments. However, it can be used as a base template for your own projects.

A modern rework of this game is planned (called **Obscelon**), featuring a completely new design, updated menus, and possibly 3D elements. The new version will be built with Node.js and modern web technologies. At the moment, no release date is set â€” the project is currently in planning and will be tackled soon.

**Note**:
- PHP-based logic, no modern frameworks
- Static layout, no responsive design
- Intended for learning or as a basic template only
